<h1>Stibium</h1>
Stibium is a web application that provides an interface similar to a traditional desktop environment (it imitates <a href="http://www.kde.org/" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false">KDE</a>) but uses a cloud service to store your files. It can be seen as a desktop enviromment to manage your files on the cloud. 
<h3>The tecnology</h3>
Stibium is powered by PHP, SVG, and Javascript, so it's all Free Open Source Software.
<br/>
We use the Ubuntu Font (<a href="http://font.ubuntu.com/" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false">Ubuntu Fonts</a>) because is a free font, and it's very nice.
<br/>
<h3>Supported Clouds</h3>
Actually, we are working to support Ubuntu One, Dropbox, ownCloud, and Google Docs. 
<h3>History</h3>
Stibium has been originally created by Luca Tringali, during september 2011, and it has been released with GPL2 licence officially october the 14th (it was the 15th KDE anniversary).
<br/>The name "Stibium" came from the 51st element of the periodic table (also called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimony" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false">"antimony"</a>). Why? Because the stibium is the element of alchemy, and it has a nice appering. And it sounds as a good name for a program.
<h3>Requirements for the client</h3>
To access Stibium as a client, all you need is a web browser supporting HTML5 and a Javascript.
For example, one of these:
</br>
</br>
<table border="1" align="center">
<tr>
<td>IE</td><td>Firefox</td><td>Safari</td><td>Chrome</td><td>Opera</td><td>iPhone</td><td>Android</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8.0+</td><td>3.5+</td><td>4.0+</td><td>4.0+</td><td>10.5+</td><td>2.0+</td><td>2.0+</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Requirements for the server</h3>
The server that hosts Stibium must support php and OAuth. It's recommended to have at least 2GB of free space on the server, so Stibium can create some temporary files.
</br>Obiously, it's a lot better if the server uses SSL to encrypt connection (it's not a good idea to send important data through an unsecure connection).
</br>There are also some other programs that should be installed on the server to let some things work:
<ul>
<li>ffmpeg: video editing</li>
<li>imagemagick: image editing, PDF conversion</li>
<li>googlecl: Google Docs support</li>
</ul>
