This directory contains the javacript code to WebODF as well as applications that use it. The applications are browser applications, commandline applications and unit tests.

lib/
lib/core/    Parts of WebODF that also work on JavaScript runtimes without a
             document window.
lib/gui/     Parts of WebODF that require a domtree

The library should be able to run in a number of different runtimes. Currently these are:
 - a webbrowser
 - node.js
 - rhino
A common API is implemented for these three environments in the files lib/browser.js, lib/node.js and lib/rhino.js respectively.



Requirements on the code

There are several requirements that need to met before code can be considered for inclusion in WebODF. Most requirements can be checked automatically, a few have to be checked by hand. A contribution must:
 - be contributed under the appropriate license
 - be javascript
 - not give any warnings in a JSLint check
 - be unchanged when passed through jsbeautifier
 - compile with the closure compiler
 - must pass all the unit tests that were passed before
   - as separate js files in the currenlty used Node.JS implementation
   - as a single compiled file in the currenlty used Node.JS implementation
   - as separate js files in the currenlty used Rhino implementation
   - as a single compiled file Rhino implementation
 - must have equal or greater code coverage for the each of the test runs

The automatic checks can be performed by running a dedicated command that reports in an xml file. This report is compared to the previous report.

runtests.js is the command that creates a report.
